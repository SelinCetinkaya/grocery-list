# Stock-Up

# Project Overview

## Project Name

Stock-Up

## Project Description

Grocery shopping is many people's least favorite chore. Part of the reason for this is the overwhelming feeling of all of the options and being surrounded by so many people in such a large space. Even if you come with a list, it's frequently unorganized and leaves you running back and forth from section to section. Stock-Up is an app to help categorize your grocery list in an easy-to-use format, allowing you to streamline your trips to the grocery store, making them just a little more fun.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Create and use external api 
- Render data by category
- Ability to add a new grocery list item
- When list items are checked off they move to the "in the cart" section
- Use tabs to navigate between categories
- create at least 6 separate react components

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Adding an additional subcategory to organize by recipe
- Adding a saved/favorites log to save previously shopped items
- Include welcome screen

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|March 12-14| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|March 15| Project Approval | Incomplete
|March 16| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, React Components Created) | Incomplete
|March 17| Successful GET/POST API Calls | Incomplete
|March 18| MVP Complete / Begin Post-MVP  | Incomplete
|March 19| Post-MVP / Styling | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
